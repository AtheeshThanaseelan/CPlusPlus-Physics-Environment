# C++ Physics Environment

Can be ran as a standalone C++ executable, or exported as a Python module.

Requires Irrlicht, Bullet3, and pybind11 libraries.

The program creates a physics environment, as well as a visual representation of the objects in it. It also provides an interface, in C++ and Python, to interact with the object's physical properties. It also provides a world with properties, such as temperature, which can be used to affect how the behaves.

Eventually a Python program will be made to demonstrate moving data between Python and the environment.
